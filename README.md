# Machine Learning Sign Language Detection

## Application Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect and interpret sign language gestures. The primary goal is to facilitate communication for individuals who rely on sign language by providing a tool that can translate gestures into text.


### Key Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: The application can process live video input from a webcam, detecting and recognizing sign language gestures in real-time.
- **High Accuracy**: Employs state-of-the-art machine learning models trained on extensive sign language datasets to ensure high accuracy in gesture recognition.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Features an intuitive and accessible user interface for easy operation and interaction.
- **Versatile Use Cases**: Suitable for educational purposes, communication aid for the hearing impaired, and as a tool for learning sign language.

### How It Works

1. **Data Acquisition**: The application captures video frames from the input source (webcam or video file).
2. **Preprocessing**: The captured frames are preprocessed to standardize input size and format.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Key features from the hand gestures are extracted using computer vision techniques.
4. **Classification**: The extracted features are fed into the trained neural network model to classify the gestures into corresponding sign language symbols.
5. **Output Display**: The recognized sign language gestures are displayed as text on the user interface.

##Applications

- **Assistive Technology: Helping individuals with hearing or speech impairments communicate more effectively.
- **Educational Tools: Providing an interactive learning tool for people interested in learning sign language.
- **Integration with Other Technologies: Potential integration with virtual assistants and other AI-driven applications to enhance their accessibility.
